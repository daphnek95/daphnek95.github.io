        <h2 class="force-center blue--dark">Photography &amp; Videography</h2>

        <p>Photos and video are taken with a Nikon D750. Animations are created in either Blender or a mix of After Effects and Photoshop. For my animations they start with a storyboard and sketches, then assets and backgrounds are designed and created before adding the movement and actual animation. <!--Follow along with my work on <a class="link-white-bg--orange" href="https://www.instagram.com/daizziestudio/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>--></p>

        <p class="emphasis--text">Below are a few selected photography &amp; videography projects. Check out <a class="link-white-bg--blue" href="../graphic-design/index.html">graphic design</a> or <a class="link-white-bg--blue" href="../coding/index.html">coding</a> works here.</p>
