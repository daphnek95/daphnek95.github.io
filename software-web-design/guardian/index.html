			Life, if you can even call it that, up here is so calm. So relaxing. Tall, glossy golden gates fade into the pearl colored clouds. The clouds are soft and moist, making it the perfect substance to walk on when you don't want to fly. Everything in Heaven is pastel in color and looks very fancy. Although, the designs themselves are actually really simple. My favorite spot in Heaven is the viewing quarters. It's a relaxing spot for angels and the souls of the deceased to watch their family members and other loved ones. Since I'm a guardian angel, I can help guide my loved ones from the viewing quarters. Sometimes, I'll visit the viewing quarters to relax by the gentle waterfall and listen to the hushed sound of the water falling. I don't spend all of my time in Heaven though. Occasionally, I visit Earth to see places that hold special memories of my past. I also guide my friends on Earth, but only on rare occasions. I can't communicate with them for very long. It'd be a false statement if I said I didn't miss my old life and my friends, but I do enjoy my role now.

			Ellie is very close to me, pratically my sister. She was the first person I met when I woke up in Heaven. Ellie is rather petite in size, and looks very fragile with her beautiful light brown curls, dimples and rosy cheeks. You'd be surprised to see how strong she really is. Ellie has seen so many things and has been in so many journeys as an angel. I love to hear her marvelous tales. When I first met her, she immediatly took care of me and helped me with this new life. She introduced me to two fellow guardian angels, Samuel and Jessica. I've learned so many things from the both of them and I value their advice. Ellie also introduced me to her friends, Emily and Jacob. I never really talked to them but they seem very nice.
			Getting here though was something I never, not in a million years, even thought would or could happen. But, I guess life never really goes as expected and tests your strength within. I was in my junior year in high school and everything was going terrific. I might not have been popular or been a straigh A student but I had  five of the most loyal friends ever, a boyfriend who cared about me and treated me right, and I had so much potential with my viola. Life seemed to get better when I became best friends with the new junior at my school. Her name was Dana.

			Dana and I quickly became closer and closer when we found out how much we had in common. She also became quite attatched to my friends but Dana and I pretty much became one person. Slowly, I started to notice some odd shadows in rooms that Dana would be in. Then, I started noticing change within my group of friends and then my boyfriend. No one else seemed to notice the change, but I, I saw it clear as day. My only remaining question: why?
