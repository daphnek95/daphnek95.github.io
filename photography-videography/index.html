          <p class="force-left">One person I had the pleasure of working with while on my Disney College Program was a young man named Nich. We worked together often at Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. He is a theater kid at heart and often models. Since he learned that I freelance photography, we decided to do a collaborative session at Disney's Epcot park and Disney's Hollywood Studios park. As a big fan of Disney, we were both blown away at how none of the pictures screamed "Disney". Working with him was an absolute treasure and we were able to get very artistic with the poses and pictures. Below is a small glimpse into my favorite session to date.</p>

          <p class="force-left">During my last semester at Illinois State University, I was given the opportunity to produce and film, alongside three other students, a promotional video for the Arts Techology program, now known as Creative Technologies. My role was primarily director, as we went with my presented concept. Not only did I direct and film the varying scenes, I also edited the "wizarding world" portion of our promo. The premise of the promo was as follows: as arts technology students we have the creative minds and learn the skills to create the fantasy worlds around us. A tired ATK (Arts Technology Student) falls asleep while working on a project and is guided by a golden snitch into different creative worlds- the wizarding world of Harry Potter, to a galaxy far far away with Star Wars, and eventually down a sewer pipe through Mario's crazy world. Every team member was responsible for editing a particular segment of the video before being carefully placed together.</p>

The cast all became like family, and they knew I freelance in photography. On one of my days off, I was asked to document fellow cast's daily life at the Mountain and with the parade through photography. Below are a few glimpses of the photoshoot that followed.</p>

An old YouTuber I used to follow recently started ghost hunting and they always say "I got CHILLS" whenever they started to get scared. It inspired a more gothic approach to the classic lyrics from Grease "I got chills, they're multiplying". Everything was created in Adobe After Effects to achieve the final look.</p>

          <p class="force-left">Nicholas and Alyssa were an absolutely fun couple to work together and photograph. After roughly two years together, they got engaged on Thanksgiving and quickly planned a winter themed wedding for the following year. Alyssa was a determined bride and I was eager to make her dreams a reality when she said she wanted engagement photos done in the snow. Her fiance was hilarious and while cold, tried his best to make his future bride happy. Below are a few snippets from the chilly session!</p>

          <p class="force-left">When I first started learning Blender, 3D design, and 3D animation I learned about an artist challenge called the '5 second Challenge' by creator GreyScaleGorilla. The artist posts roughly three new catagories every month for artists to choose and are then challenged to animate a five second animation based on a word or theme. When I partook in the challenge, video games was one of the themes and was immediately drawn to it. I had several ideas going back to classic games I would play as a child- Putt Putt, Freddie Fish, Frogger, etc. It didn't take long before I remembered a game I had a truly love-hate relationship with- The Oregon Trail. This game was HARD. I never won. Most people I knew who played that game almost always died as well. So the concept of The Impossible Trail was made! Before this poor family even embarks onto the trail, they quickly die a very sad death.</p>

          <p class="force-left">While studying animation and video editing at Illinois State University I was given the opportunity to put together a promotional video for the university's theater department where they would be performing a play called She Kills Monsters. Before putting anything together on Adobe After Effects, I met with the leading ladies of the show, held individual photo shoots with them, and filmed a live-action roleplay group on campus. Since the play takes on a similar style to live-action roleplay (or LARPing) and often flashes between that and the modern world, capturing footage of LARPing in action seemed crucial to the aesthetic of the promotional video. After some photo editing in Photoshop, everything was brought over to After Effects to bring the video together.</p>
