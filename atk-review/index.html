				<h2>ATK 201 -- Daily Habit</h2>
				<p>For a month or two of the semester, we were supposed to choose a task that we would spend at least five minutes of the day and work on it every single day. Since I am interested in enamel pins, I decided to create a new pin every day. That semester I actually produced one of these pins and have designed more pins since.</p>

				<h2>ATK 240 -- Sound Design</h2>
				<p>Below are my two favorite assignments from the semester. I discovered a love for sound design and enjoyed every single assignment. First audio file: SFX Narrative. A man living in a war zone is keeping his mind off things by eating popcorn when his neighborhood is ambushed and fighting insues. He is knocked unconcious when a bomb explodes nearby. Second audio: Underscore. Taking some sort of speech or spoken word, we were supposed to change the feeling or purpose of the speech by only changing the music underneath. I recorded my father reading the Rome section of Disney's Spaceship Earth ride in Epcot and underlaid it with Kevin MacLeod's song "Past the Edge II" to create a mystic, somber feeling. <a href="http://www.intercot.com/edc/SpaceshipEarth/spscript.html" target="_blank">See script here.</a></p>

				<h2>ART 284 -- Cuddle Pants</h2>
				<p>The goal of this project was to design wearable technology. Each of us worked in pairs, and I was lucky to work with a pal named Cassidy. The two of us joked about how strange it would be to have a pair of pants that had a pillow on them and that would cuddle with a friend or significant other while you were on your phone or reading. Thus the Cuddle Pants were born!</p>

				<h2>ATK 302 -- Frogger Influenced Game</h2>
				<p>Before the final project, our class was tasked to create a game using a similar style to the Frogger arcade game. We had to create an aspect to the game that was unique and our own. I decided to create a four level game, where you play a volunteer at an animal shelter. Click the image below to play the game!</p>

				<h2>ATK 398  -- Immersion Arcade</h2>
				<p>For my internship, I worked for a virtual reality arcade startup company. There I was a social media intern, so I ran their social media handles. Also, I designed tee shirt concepts. The biggest project was coding a new website design for the company. Click the first image below to view the coded site!</p>

				<h2>ART 371 -- Useless Everyday Objects</h2>
				<p>This was the second project of the semester where we were to take an everyday object and change one factor of it to render it useless. For my project, I took the lightbulb and replaced the glass bulb with a balloon.</p>

				<h2>ATK 380 -- Farm Boy Documentary</h2>
				<p>For class, I was tasked to film and edit an interview. I chose to interview my father who had grown up on a farm, to discuss what it was like to grow up on a farm. I always hear wonderful stories about farmlife around family bonfires, so it seemed fitting to sit around a fire while we interviewed. It was fun to create an old nostalgic, country feel to this interview. Click the first image below to watch the interview!</p>

				<h2>ATK 380 -- One Squid Wonder</h2>
				<p>The task: CSS Animation. The result: One Squid Wonder. This cyclop squid made his debut for Advanced Web Design while tinkering around and exploring CSS animation. Bubbles move beneath and around him as he swims upwards. Click on the image below to see him in action!</p>
