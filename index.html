				<h2>Social Media Intern - Startup Company</h2>
				<p>I was given the incredible opportunity to work as an intern for the local starup company, Immersion Arcade. My official title was Social Media Intern, but working with a startup company means you do whatever tasks needed even if they don't necessarily fall into your job description. But, being one of the creatives at the company I was tasked with coding a new site for Immersion Arcade. Click the large image below to view the website.</p>

				<h2>Birthday Song Site</h2>
				<p>This parallax design site is focused around the number one hit for my birthday as given in my Advanced Web Design class at ISU. On my birthday, the number one hit was Bryan Adams' song, "Have You Really Loved A Woman." It's a fun little website that gives a little insight to the inspiration behind the song, including a video of the song as well. Click the large image below to view the site.</p>

				<h2>CSS Animation</h2>
				<p>The One Squid Wonder is animated strictly via css code. The squid however is actually created in Adobe Illustrator and is an svg file. This was one of the first assignments in my Advanced Web Design class at ISU. The goal is to have the One Squid Wonder appear to be floating on the screen.

				<h2>P5JS - Animation/Slideshow Site</h2>
				<p>This site was actually an assignment for my Software Design II course at ISU. I had designed a time based processing animation that I converted into javascript. It's inspired by "found footage" horror films. This particular case is a photographer that has rigged his camera to take photos every second or so. You - the photographer - is viewing the photos as they come in. However the camera tends to glitch out when you notice this thing watching you. Click the large image below to view the site.</p>

				<h2>P5JS - Drawing Program</h2>
				<p>Since learning how to convert processing pde files to javascript, I took an earlier assignment from Software Design II and brought it to the internet. This fun little drawing program was inspired by Tetris. Click the large image below to view the game!</p>

				<h2>University Program Board - Graphic Design Committee</h2>
				<p>For three years now, I've been blending my proficiency in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to design and produce signage for campus events sponsered by UPB and Up Late at State. While I do not have a site of my designs, I do have some samples located below.</p>
