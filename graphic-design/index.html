I drew inspiration from the game series Diablo and The Haunted Mansion to bring to life four different skeletal coasters for Halloween. These coasters were created by first cutting out a circle on stamp material, pouring a silicone mold over the top, and then pouring resin in small layers- adding vinyl and flowers in between different pours. The vinyl designs were created on Procreate on an iPad Pro, then dropped into Cricut design software and cut on a Cricut Joy.

This in particular was a favorite design. It was first sketched on paper, then brought to Adobe Illustrator to create assets, and finalized on Adobe Photoshop.</p>

          <p class="force-left">Lily was a treasure to work with. I had the pleasure of meeting her before we started our Disney College Program in 2019. As many interns planned to do, Lily wanted to document her experience working with the Walt Disney Company through a YouTube channel. She was interning within the costume department where she would clean and maintain all cast costumes. Not only did she commission me to design a YouTube banner for her, I was asked to design a profile picture to match. Lily is a huge Star Wars fan, Rey being her favorite character. She wanted a primarily Star Wars theme with some sort of nod to her passion of fashion and her role in costuming. Therefore I designed Lily as Rey herself, but included Mickey ears and a pin cushion daintily resting on her wrist as a subtle nod to her future internship with the company. In my time leading up to my Disney College Program, I was commissioned to design introduction clips, banners, and profile pictures for YouTube. Below are a few examples of other work completed.</p>

          <p class="force-left">While at Illinois State University, one of my favorite classes was 3D Design. In that class we focused on 3D printing and sculpting using Blender. One of our first projects we printed in that class were coffee cup sleeves. Our only requirement was to experiment with the shape and design of the traditional coffee cup sleeve- we had to think and design in a way that affects the way the cup feels and sits in someone's hand, to make it a unique experience. My design was inspired by bronze cufflets often worn by warriors and beginner level players in many RPG games. In particular I was inspired by an old online game, Runescape. The pointed out design is not sharp enough to stab or scrape the user, but offers the perfect indentation for your fingers to rest on, between or around. On one section of the sleeve there is a slight curve inwards for the thumb to rest perfectly. It is hefty and pleasing to hold, while still maintaining a fun unique design.</p>

          <p class="force-left">One of my favorite forms of graphic design is digital collage. I like to use public domain photography resources to gain vintage photos or drawings and blend them together for statements on beauty, self worth, health, and pain. This particular piece is only three images spliced together, colored, and layered on top of textured backgrounds. For me, it represents beauty standards and idealized beauty thats always pushed onto young girls. These designs are usually created on Adobe Photoshop, but recently I've been using Affinity Photo and Procreate to achieve the same results.</p>

          <p class="force-left">During my college career, I invested most of my free time to the University Program Board's graphics committee. The University Program Board, or UPB for short, was a student organization that not only held campus events for students but endorsed and advertised for other student led campus events. For the graphics committee, we were in charge of designing all forms of advertisement for varying events through banners, handbills, buttons, TV advertisements, and social media images. With this particular project, I was tasked with creating magnets for all UPB members and students to keep up to date on the semester's events to look forward to. Since it was an in-house project for UPB, it had to follow strict branding standards.</p>

          <p class="force-left">While studying 3D design, my teacher challenged the class to recreate a common household item but to change one aspect of it that would render the object useless. It didn't take long for the concept of a balloon lightbulb to pop into my head. How would the balloon stay full? Would you have to replace a bulb when too much air escaped? What shape would the balloon take? Realistically a balloon would not be a sustainable replacement to glass, especially when you add in the electricity of a lightbulb. The balloon would most likely pop. This was a fun exploration at product design with an exciting twist.</p>

          <p class="force-left">Nintendo Night was perhaps my favorite assignment from my time with Illinois State University's University Program Board. For every project with UPB (University Program Board) I start out with a base design for either a landscape or portrait style poster. Once the design is fleshed out, I carry elements of the main poster for social media ads, TV ads, buttons, and handbills to pass out around campus. I had never tackled 8-bit design before but Adobe Illustrator made the process fairly simple. Once assets were created in Illustrator, I brought them over to Adobe Photoshop for final tweaking and layout decisions.</p>

The hunger banquet was a special event to raise awareness to the realities of poverty and world hunger. It seemed fitting, to go with a very minimalistic design to echo the lack of food and it's importance in human life. The design would be put together in one Photoshop document and once completed, copied over to a second document where four handbills could be placed together to be printed on one standard sized piece of paper (8.5x11).</p>

          <p class="force-left">What started out as a weekly task my sophomore year of college, turned into a new passion of mine. My very first class for Arts Technology tried to instil daily artistic habits in its students to help nourish and build the artist within. We individually decided what habit we would build and reported every week the progress we've made on our habit. I've always loved enamel pins- I have a huge collection of Disney pins tucked away safely in my home- so it seemed only natural to explore the process of pin making and to sketch out a new pin design every day. Now, some sketches were better than others, but I am a huge fan of the parannormal and all things Halloween/spooky, and this particular design was my favorite I had made that semester. For the next year I saved up money and ended up producing 100 of these pins and brought them to life. It was an extrodinary process to collaborate with other artists to bring my fleshed out design into a physical enamel pin. I still have some for sale in my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/delicateentity" target="_blank" class="link-white-bg--blue">artist shop</a>, and they are quite a favorite among my customers. This eventually led me to resin work and moldmaking where I make my own resin pins.</p>

          <p class="force-left">After I produced my first enamel pin, I was looking to other mediums where I could bring my artwork into the physical world. Quickly it led me to sticker designs! I have several stached away in my artist morgue file, but this has always been a favorite of mine. The design was created on my iPad Pro with Procreate and was printed through a company called Sticker Mule. Since then, I have researched sticker paper and have plans to produce stickers completely on my own. This particular sticker and the enamel pin shown above paved the way for my passion of product design.</p>
