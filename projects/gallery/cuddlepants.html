			<h2>CuddlePants -- Wearable Technology</h2>
			<p>This is perhaps my favortie project to date that I have worked on. For a major course at Illinois State University, students were tasked to work in pairs to code and then create a piece of wearable technology. In class, we had been creating figures by laser-cutting acrylic and learning how to code with the Arduino UNO. For this particular assignment, I paired up with my friend Cassidy Fisher. At the time, I had just discovered that there are "Professional Cuddlers" in California. The service is much like a therapy session or a message session, except you are paying hourly or half hourly rates to have someone cuddle with you. I had thought the idea was so bizarre and amazing at the same time. Cassidy and I started joking that it would be brilliant to design a pair of pants that would cuddle with you. The more we talked about it, the more we loved it and so did our professor. With lots of sewing and a few lines of code, the CuddlePants were born. Below takes you through our two week process of creating these pants. It was a hit with the class and ran beautifully. Sadly, the pants have been retired since their opening debut.</p>
