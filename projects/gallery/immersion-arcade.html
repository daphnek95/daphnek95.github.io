			<h2>Immersion Arcade -- Virtual Reality Arcade</h2>
			<p>Immersion Arcade was a startup company located in Bloomington, Illinois. It was actually the first virtual reality arcade in the United States. I was a social media intern, but working with a startup company I had to quickly adapt to other areas in the business. In the end, I designed a few Snapchat Geo Filters, created company tee shirts, and coded a website. Sadly, the company lost their lease and had to shut their doors when they couldn't find another location.</p>
